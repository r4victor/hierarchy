# A service for managing hierarchical structure

## Overview
This service provides an API for working with a set of items by forming an hierarchy. Hierarchy is represented by a collection of trees.
Each item within a tree has a unique name and points to its parent ( which is 'null' in case of a root item).
One can create, rename, move and delete items within the hierarchy.
